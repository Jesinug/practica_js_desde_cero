## Web basics: Javascript from scratch ðŸ•¹
## Console application - Classroom management system
> This is a practice delivery in the framework of the [Glovo-KeepCoding Bootcamp "Women in Tech"](https://keepcoding.io/nuestros-bootcamps/mujeres-glovo/)

### General considerations
- Project created 100% with Vanilla Javascript
- No use of Browser
- Fully operative upon NodeJS environment

#### Description
Development of an application made with Javascript to help us manage a class of students.

#### Implementation details
Run with the console command `node challenge.js`.

#### Mandatory requirements
1- Show all the students in a table format.
2- Show by console the number of pupils in the class.
3- Show by console all the names of the pupils.
4- Delete the last pupil in the class.
5- Eliminate a student randomly from the class.
6- Show by console all the data of the pupils who are girls.
7- Show by console the number of boys and girls in the class.
8- Show true or false by console if all the students in the class are girls.
9- Show by console the names of the students who are between 20 and 25 years old.
10- Add a new student with the following data:
- random name.
- random age between 20 and 50 years old.
- random gender.
- empty list of grades.

*NOTE: the name and gender must match.
11- Display by console the name of the youngest person in the class.
*NOTE: If several people in the class share the lowest age, any one of them is a valid answer.
12- Show by console the average age of all the students in the class.
13- Show by console the average age of the girls in the class.
14- Add a new mark to the students. For each student in the class, we will have to calculate a random grade (number between 0 and 10) and add it to the list of grades.
15- Sort the array of students alphabetically by name.

#### Optional requirements
16- Show by console the student of the class with the best marks.
The student with the highest marks is the one whose sum of all his marks is the highest value of all.
17- Show by console the highest average mark of the class and the name of the pupil to whom it belongs.
18- Add an extra point to each existing mark of all the pupils. Remember that the maximum possible mark is 10. If students have not yet recorded any marks, we will give them a 10.

#### Assessment considerations
The application must run under the Node.js environment, NOT in the browser.
In order for the practice to be considered OK, ALL the essential requirements must work correctly.
It is important that each requirement is responsive to what is needed. That is, if a requirement asks for the number of students that meet a condition, the result must be just a number, and not the list of students that meet that condition. If this happens, it will be considered as an incorrect answer.
Optional requirements will not be penalised negatively if they are wrong or halved. I will appreciate it if you try. If you don't succeed, please leave a commented code with the question that made you unable to continue so that I can help you.
